# AutoHotkey

[AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) is a super powerful scripting language for Windows, that is great for remapping keys, creating macros, text expansion, etc.

## Installing

1. Download AutoHotkey from [here](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe).
2. To run [AutoHotkey.ahk](AutoHotkey.ahk) automatically either move the file to the Windows startup folder or create a shortcut link to it. You can also just double-click the script to run it.

## Shortcuts

[AutoHotkey.ahk](AutoHotkey.ahk) contains shortcuts I add as I need them. These are the shortcuts currently in the script:

### RStudio
