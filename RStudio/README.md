# RStudio

RStudio is an IDE for R. It's what most people think of when talking about R.

## Theme

Full credit for this theme goes to johnnybarrels (the original repo is [here](https://github.com/johnnybarrels/rstudio-one-dark-pro-theme)).

### Installing the Theme

1. Download the [OneDarkPro.rstheme](OneDarkPro.rstheme) file.
2. In Rstudio, open Tools -> Global Options -> Appearance.
3. Click `Add...` and select the theme.

## Font

I really like [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) for working in R, because of the ligatures.

### Installing the Font

Just follow the instructions on the [FiraCode Repo](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)
